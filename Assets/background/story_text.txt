In a world where technology has advanced beyond measure, a programmer named Tim was tasked with fixing
bugs in the system. He was the best programmer in the world, but the bugs were getting the better of 
him. So, he decided to enter the virtual world of the game "Debugger" to defeat the bugs once and for
all and reset the program.

His main objective is to get to the internal computer as fast, so he can reset the program, and destroy
any bugs that stand in his way.
